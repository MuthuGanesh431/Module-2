# Built-in Functions -Binary Conversion Using Built-in Functions in Python

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program to convert the number **16** into its **binary representation** using built-in Python functions.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Assign the value `16` to a variable `a`.
2. Use the built-in `bin()` function to convert the number to binary.
3. Print the result.

## ðŸ§¾ Program

Add Code Here
```py
# Step 1: Assign the value 16 to a variable
a = 16

# Step 2: Convert the number to binary using bin()
binary_representation = bin(a)

# Step 3: Print the result
print("Binary representation of", a, "is", binary_representation)
```
